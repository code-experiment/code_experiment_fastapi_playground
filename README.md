# Code Experiment FastAPI Playground

This is a playground built during the Code Experiment meetup. We will slowly be building a Todo app with authentication. If you would like to join please head over to https://code-experiment.netlify.app/ and join our slack, we meet every Tuesday at 6:00 pm MST.

If you want to catchup, please clone this repo and follow the steps below.

## Environment Setup

**Create Virtual Environment:**

> Wherever you run this command it will create a `venv` folder. If you want the folder to be called something different change the second `venv`.

> Make sure you are inside the `code_experiment_playground` folder when you run this command.

```
# Mac
$ python3 -m venv venv

# PC
$ python -m venv venv
```

**Activate The Virtual Environment:**

> Make sure you are inside the `code_experiment_playground` folder when you run this command.

```
# Mac
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ _

# Windows
$ venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) $ _
```

**Installing Packages:**

> Make sure you are inside the `code_experiment_playground` folder when you run this command.

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You might need to remove the `uvloop` package on windows.

## Run The Uvicorn Server

## Warnings:

- Currently we have a warning from `python-jose` and it looks to be almost fixed. It is just a warning so we should be ok.

```
CryptographyDeprecationWarning: int_from_bytes is deprecated, use int.from_bytes instead
```

- It seems this issue is coming from aiofiles and they have a fix in release v0.6. We need to figure out what installed this. Is it ok for us to just go update this package?

DeprecationWarning: "@coroutine" decorator is deprecated since Python 3.8, use "async def" instead
